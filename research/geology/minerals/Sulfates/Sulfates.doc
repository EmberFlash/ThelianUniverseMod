Sulfates and Chromates
The basic unit of the sulfate minerals are the SO4 groups. These groups combine with metals to form the sulfate minerals. Barite, gypsum, and anhydrite are the most common sulfate minerals.

Minerals of the sulfate class:

Have vitreous luster.
Have average to above average density.
Have average hardness.
Originally formed in veins, oxidation zones, contact metamorphic zones and evaporite deposits.
Are, in some cases, soluble.
Are, in several cases, fluorescent.

The sulfate minerals are a class of minerals that include the sulfate ion (SO42?) within their structure. The sulfate minerals occur commonly in primary evaporite depositional environments, as gangue minerals in hydrothermal veins and as secondary minerals in the oxidizing zone of sulfide mineral deposits. The chromate and manganate minerals have a similar structure and are often included with the sulfates in mineral classification systems.[1]
