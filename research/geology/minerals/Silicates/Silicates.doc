Silicates
The silicate mineral class is considered to be the most important of all the mineral classes. About 25% of the known minerals and nearly 40% of the common ones are silicates. Nearly 90% of the igneous rock-forming minerals are silicates; which means that they make up over 90% of the Earth's crust (oxides are the other dominant mineral group).

Each assemblage of silicate minerals tells us something of the environment in which it was formed. The soil, in which we grow our food, is made up largely of silicates. Bricks, stones, concrete, and glass are either silicates or derived from silicates. The time in our computers and clocks is kept by a silicate mineral.

The fundamental unit on which the structure of all silicates is based consists of four oxygen ions surrounding a silicon ion. This is known as the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron (SiO4). When the silicon and oxygen atoms combine, there is a net -4 charge to the molecule. This allows other positively-charged atoms to combine with the silica tetrahedra to form minerals. The six most common positively-charged elements in the crust of the Earth that combine with the silica tetrahedra are (in order of most abundant to least abundant): aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg). In some minerals, the silica tetrahedron may join with other silica tetrahedra to form various silicate structures.

Silicate minerals are rock-forming minerals with predominantly silicate anions. They are the largest and most important class of rock-forming minerals and make up approximately 90 percent of the Earth's crust.[1][2][3]

In mineralogy, silica, or silicon dioxide SiO2, which corresponds to x=2 in the general formula, is usually considered a silicate mineral〞even though its silicate "anion" has no negative charge and it has no cations. Silica is found in nature as the mineral quartz, and its polymorphs.

On Earth, a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that have been forming and re-working the crust for billions of years. These processes include partial melting, crystallization, fractionation, metamorphism, weathering, and diagenesis.


Diatomaceous earth, a biogenic form of silica as viewed under a microscope. The imaged region measures approximately 1.13 by 0.69 mm.
Living things also contribute to this geologic cycle. For example, a type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons ("tests") from silica extracted from seawater. The tests of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment, and of diatomaceous earth.


General structure
A silicate mineral is generally an ionic solid whose anions consist predominantly of silicon and oxygen atoms.

In most minerals in the Earth's crust, each silicon atom is the center of an ideal tetrahedron, whose corners are four oxygen atoms covalently bound to it. Two adjacent tetrahedra may share a vertex, meaning that the oxygen atom is a bridge connecting the two silicon atoms. An unpaired vertex represents an ionized oxygen atom, covalently bound to a single silicon atom, that contributes one unit of negative charge to the anion.

Some silicon centers may be replaced by atoms of other elements, still bound to the four corner oxygen corners. If the substituted atom is not normally tetravalent, it usually contributes extra charge to the anion, which then requires extra cations. For example, in the mineral orthoclase [KAlSi
3O
8]
n, the anion is a tridimensional network of tetrahedra in which all oxygen corners are shared. If all tetrahedra had silicon centers, the anion would be just neutral silica [SiO
2]
n. Replacement of one every four silicon atoms by an aluminum atom results in the anion [AlSi
3O?
8]
n, whose charge is neutralized by the potassium cations K+
.

Main groups
In mineralogy, silicate minerals are classified into 7 major groups according to the structure of their silicate anion:[4][5]

Major group	structure	chemical formula	example
Nesosilicates	isolated silicon tetrahedra	[SiO4]4?	olivine.
Sorosilicates	double tetrahedra	[Si2O7]6?	epidote, melilite group.
Cyclosilicates	rings	[SinO3n]2n?	tourmaline group.
Inosilicates	single chain	[SinO3n]2n?	pyroxene group.
Inosilicates	double chain	[Si4nO11n]6n?	amphibole group.
Phyllosilicates	sheets	[Si2nO5n]2n?	micas and clays.
Tectosilicates	3D framework	[AlxSiyO(2x+2y)]x?	quartz, feldspars, zeolites.
Note that tectosilicates can only have additional cations if some of the silicon is replaced by an atom of lower valence such as aluminium. Al for Si substitution is common.
