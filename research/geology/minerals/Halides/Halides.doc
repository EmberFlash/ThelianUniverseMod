Halides
The minerals that make up the halide class include those in which the halogen elements of chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine are combined with one or more metals.

Minerals of the halide class all:

have relatively low hardness.
can be transparent.
have low specific gravities.
have good cleavage.
are poor conductors of heat and electricity.

Examples include the following:[2][3]

Atacamite Cu2Cl(OH)3
Avogadrite (K,Cs)BF
Bararite (?)(NH4)2SiF6
Bischofite (MgCl2，6H2O)
Br┨ggenite Ca(IO3)2(H2O)
Calomel HgCl
Carnallite KMgCl3，6H2O
Carnallite KMgCl，6H2O
Cerargyite/Horn Silver AgCl
Chlorargyrite AgCl, bromargyrite AgBr, and iodargyrite AgI
Cryolite Na3AlF6
Cryptohalite (a)(NH4)2SiF6
Dietzeite Ca2(IO3)2CrO4
Eglestonite Hg4OCl2
Embolite AgCl+AgBr
Eriochalcite CuCl2，2H2O
Fluorite CaF2
Halite NaCl
Lautarite Ca(IO3)2
Marshite CuI
Miersite AgI
Nantokite CuCl
Sal Ammoniac NH4Cl
Sylvite KCl
Terlinguaite Hg2OCl
Tolbachite CuCl2
Villaumite NaF
Yttrocerite (Ca,Y,Ce)F2
Yttrofluorite (Ca,Y)F2

[4] Many of these minerals are water-soluble and are often found in arid areas in crusts and other deposits as are various borates, nitrates, iodates, bromates and the like. Some, such as the fluorite group, are not water-soluble. All or most of simple halides of fluorine through iodine of all of the natural alkali metals and alkaline earth metals as well as numerous other metals and cations are found in some quantity at one or more locations. More complex minerals as shown below are also found. [5]

Commercially significant halide minerals
Two commercially important halide minerals are halite and fluorite. The former is a major source of sodium chloride, in parallel with sodium chloride extracted from sea water or brine wells. Fluorite is a major source of hydrogen fluoride, complementing the supply obtained as a byproduct of the production of fertilizer. Carnallite and bischofite are important sources of magnesium. Natural cryolite was historically required for the production of aluminium, however, currently most cryolite used is produced synthetically.

Many of the halide minerals occur in marine evaporite deposits. The Atacama Desert also has large quantities of halide minerals as well as chlorates, iodates, oxyhalides and the like as well as nitrates, borates and other water-soluble minerals！not only underground but it crusts on the surface due to the low rainfall！the Atacama is the world's driest desert as well as one of the oldest (25 million years)
