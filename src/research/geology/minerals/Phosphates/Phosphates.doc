Phosphates, Arsenates, and Vanadates
The dominant building block of this mineral class is the PO4- tetrahedron. Phosphorus, arsenic, and vanadium may substitute for each other within the tetrahedron.

The typical mineral is vitreous to dull, often strongly-colored, above average average in density, has an average hardness, and a low index of refraction. The minerals of this class can have very complex chemical relationships and structures. It is a large mineral class, but many members are rare.


Phosphate minerals are those minerals that contain the tetrahedrally coordinated phosphate (PO43?) anion along with the freely substituting arsenate (AsO43?) and vanadate (VO43?). Chlorine (Cl?), fluorine (F?), and hydroxide (OH?) anions that also fit into the crystal structure.

The phosphate class of minerals is a large and diverse group, however, only a few species are relatively common.

Applications
Main article: Phosphate rock
Phosphate rock is rock with high concentration of phosphate minerals, most commonly of the apatite group. It is the major resource mined to produce phosphate fertilizers for the agriculture sector. Phosphate is also used in animal feed supplements, food preservatives, anti-corrosion agents, cosmetics, fungicides, ceramics, water treatment and metallurgy.

The largest use of minerals mined for their phosphate content is the production of fertilizer.

Phosphate minerals are often used for control of rust and prevention of corrosion on ferrous materials applied with electrochemical conversion coatings.
